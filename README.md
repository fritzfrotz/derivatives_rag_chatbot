Derivatives Chatbot ü§ñ
Welcome to the Derivatives Chatbot project, developed for the Derivatives Academy! This interactive chatbot, built with Streamlit, LangChain, and OpenAI, is designed to answer market finance questions, specifically focusing on derivatives. The bot retrieves relevant content from a document-based knowledge base, processes user queries, and generates concise responses.

üìë Project Overview
The chatbot leverages LangChain‚Äôs document retrieval and large language model (LLM) capabilities to answer derivatives-related questions. Core features include:

Document processing and text chunking for efficient information retrieval
Vector storage and document retrieval with Chroma
Real-time conversation management
User feedback collection at session end
The chatbot UI is built with Streamlit, designed to be user-friendly with a themed chat bubble design for easy interaction.

üìÇ Project Structure
The project is organized into two main files:

app2.py: The main Streamlit application handling UI, conversation history, and interactions with backend functions.
functions1.py: Contains the core functionality for document loading, text chunking, vector storage, retrieval, prompt formatting, and feedback saving.
